 How are graceful degradation and service workers related? <br><br>

 Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both addresses "degrade gracefully" where you start out with a "max technology" but then address other levels with grace. This is seen with how service workers are used to implement functionality offline, showing a lower level "gracefulness" compares to max technology (when the application is not offline). From this lab, we can see caching resources and network request catches compared to letting the app break, allowing it to still work in a not ideal circumstance(offline). This would allow users to still have access to some parts of the app in other applications although not at max.
